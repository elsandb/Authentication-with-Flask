A simple Flask web application where a user can sign up or log in, download a 'Flask cheat sheet', 
and log out. 

It was made with the purpose of learning:

- how to register, login and logout users with email and password.
- how to allow users to download a document if they have signed up/logged in.
- how to keep the users' passwords safe from hackers (salting and hashing).
